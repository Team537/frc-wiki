# Learn Java

Currently our robot is programmed using the Java programming language. It's strongly recommended that you're familiar with programming in Java/a similar language before diving into robotics as everything is built on understanding programming.

##### As with most other things, learning things for the first time can be difficult. 

It is important that you learn certain things that are commonly found in our code:
* Variable types
* Importing & exporting
* Methods
* Objects
* Control flow loops
* Instances
* and more

This may sound like a lot now, but once you start its not far until you know it all!
